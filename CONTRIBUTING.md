This document serves mostly as a way for me to standardize my coding
style and explicitly express what the "rules" are.

## Coding Style

Per the Ruby style guide, technically I'm supposed to use two-space
soft tabs, but instead I use smart tabs. For the sake of line length
calculation, a tab character should be considered as being exactly two
characters wide. This width should _absolutely_ not be used for other
calculations, however.  Tabs are to be used for indentation and spaces
are to be used for alignment.
